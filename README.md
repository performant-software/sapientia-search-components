## Storybook

This repo uses Storybook for development builds of the components.

Before running Storybook, you need to run `npm run storybook build`. This is just for building Storybook itself, so you'll only need to run it once (or if you've updated the `storybook` package).

With Storybook built, you can run `npm run storybook` to open Storybook and get live builds of the components.
